# FinalProject_IS733
The project focuses on optimizing the review process of employee suggestions in a large human resource company's online forum. The primary challenge was to create a sustainable and scalable method to filter out less impactful suggestions, a task previously performed manually. The major findings that informed our approach include anomalies in the data set, such as instances where votes (both up and down) exceeded the number of views, and cases where the number of responses surpassed the views. Additionally, rows with zero views were also identified. These discrepancies highlighted the need for a more robust and automated analysis system. Leveraging these insights, we developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying and prioritizing suggestions based on engagement metrics and content relevance. This method significantly reduces manual sorting and ensures a more accurate and efficient evaluation of employee feedback. The results demonstrate the project's success in enhancing the company's ability to identify and act on valuable suggestions, thereby fostering a more responsive and employee-centric corporate culture.
